This project was initially created alongside [freeCodeCamp's React Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8) with the purpose of gaining valuable experience creating and developing React applications.

After completion of the React tutorial, this project was then augmented with additional features such as:
* Creating a GitHub Pages site to publicly serve the web-app
* Implementing a CI/CD Pipeline utilizing GitHub Actions to lint, test, build, and deploy the application (to GitHub Pages) upon code changes
* Utilizing CSS and conditional logic to create the appropriate "dots" on the die-faces
* Calculating a completed game's total time-spent from beginning to end
* Reporting to the user the achieved score as well as the currently stored "high-score"
* Storing a user/browser's calculated high-score to localStorage

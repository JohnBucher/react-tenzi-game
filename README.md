# Tenzies Game

This project was initially created alongside [freeCodeCamp's React Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8) with the purpose of gaining valuable experience creating and developing React applications.

After completion of the React tutorial, this project was then augmented with additional features such as:
* Using CSS to create "dots" on the die faces
* Calculating a completed game's number of clicks and time-spent
* Storing a user/browser's high-score for both metrics above to localStorage
